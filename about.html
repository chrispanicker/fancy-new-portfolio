			<h3 class="">Who am I?</h3>
			<p >My name’s Chris Panicker. I'm a design, animator, artist, and amateur skateboarder. Currently, I'm studying communication design at Parsons.</p>
			<h3>Why Design?</h3>
			<p>I am a designer who experiments with crossing the boundaries between mediums, from creative code to the moving image. I consider my practice to be holistically interactive, whether considering user engagement on the web, or utilizing the medium to dictate the output of my work. I’ve worked on identity development, web experiences, animations, and 2D/3D art. Ultimately, my goal for my work is to engage with people in unexpected ways, directly and indirectly.
			</p>

			<h3>So what do I do?</h3>
			<p>My coursework at parsons has included branding, web design, animated short films, 3D art, photography, and video. I also have worked as a freelance designer, photographer, and videographer.
			</p>
		
			<h3>I am experienced with a variety of software:</h3>
			<p>Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro X, Autodesk Maya, to name a few.</p>

			<h3>I am also proficient in these coding languages:</h3>
			<p>HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
